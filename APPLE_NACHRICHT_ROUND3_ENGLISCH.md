# 📝 Message to Apple - Round 3 (English)

---

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Guideline 2.3.

**Issue:** The app description contained a "KEYWORDS:" section that was not relevant to the app's functionality.

**Solution:**
We have removed the entire "KEYWORDS:" section from the app description. The description now focuses exclusively on the actual features and functionality of the app.

**Updated Description:**
The new description has been updated in App Store Connect and includes:
- Description of main features (AI Consultation, Photo Analysis, Medication Tracker, etc.)
- Supported pet types (dogs, cats, birds, etc.)
- Multi-language support
- Privacy features
- Important disclaimer information

**Removed:**
- The entire "KEYWORDS:" section has been completely removed

The app description is now fully focused on the actual functionality of the app and complies with Guideline 2.3.

The app is ready for re-review.

Best regards
