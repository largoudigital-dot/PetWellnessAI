Hello,

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed all the issues mentioned:

**1. Keywords (Guideline 2.3):**
Keywords have been reduced to relevant terms: `pethealth,petcare,AIassistant,petwellness,petsymptoms,pettracker,petrecords`

**2. ATT/GDPR Flow (Guideline 5.1.1):**
The ATT dialog is now shown ONLY when GDPR Consent has been granted. If the user denies consent, the ATT dialog will NOT be shown anymore.

**3. Regulatory Compliance & Citations (Guideline 1.4.1):**
- Prominent medical disclaimers have been added to all relevant views (Chat, Photo Analysis, Symptoms, Tutorials, Resources, Emergency)
- Citations button has been added to all views for easy access to sources
- The AI does NOT provide medical diagnoses and does NOT provide treatment recommendations

**4. Bug Fix (Guideline 2.1):**
Error handling on app startup has been improved. No error dialogs are shown on app startup anymore.

All changes have been implemented and tested. The app is ready for re-review.

Best regards
